## Setting Up Your MERN Stack Project: Trance

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm**: Download and install the latest version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en). Note that npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js installation and is essential for managing project dependencies.
  
- **Git**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is necessary for version control and cloning the project repository.

- **MongoDB**: Ensure you have MongoDB installed locally or set up an account with a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas. This database is crucial for storing application data.

- **A Code Editor**: We recommend Visual Studio Code, but you can use any editor of your choice that supports JavaScript development.

- **A Terminal or Command Prompt**: This is where you'll execute most of the commands during setup and development.

### 1. Create a New Project Directory
Open your terminal and navigate to the desired location for your project:
```bash
mkdir trance-project
cd trance-project
```

### 2. Clone the Project from GitHub
Clone the project repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sriramsenthill/trance.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies for your MERN stack project:
1. Open the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd trance-project/trance/client
   ```
3. Run this command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
4. Once the installation is complete, go to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd trance-project/trance/server
   ```
5. Run the command to install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
6. Install `bcryptjs` for password hashing:
   ```bash
   npm install bcryptjs
   ```

### 4. Start the Development Server
1. Go back to the `Server` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open another terminal window, navigate to the `client` directory again, and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This should start both the client and server on your local host at ports 3000 (server) and 3001 (client).

With these steps, you're set up to utilize Trance effectively in your development environment!
